# [Where's My Ball] üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: [sockit]


### Team Members
- Member 1: [Nandana M] - [College of engineering Trivandrum]
- Member 2: [Shruthy R] - [College of engineering Trivandrum]

### Project Description
We built a system that knows exactly where your ball is at all times ‚Äî not to return it, not to play with it, but simply to admire its existence. Using ultrasonic sensors, trilateration, and PyGame, we‚Äôve d acheived the art of pointless precision.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[The ball‚Äôs path is poetry. But without our tech, it‚Äôs unread poetry‚Ä¶ lost forever to the winds of chance (and gravity).]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[So we built a system to translate the ball‚Äôs silent poetry into a visual masterpiece. Using ultrasonic sensors, trilateration, and PyGame, we map every twist, turn, and tumble ‚Äî preserving its story in real time, so no moment of its epic journey is ever lost to chance (or gravity]

This is our code for finding the x and y coordinates of the ball using a method called trilateration commonly used in robotics.
